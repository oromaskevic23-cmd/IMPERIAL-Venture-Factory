# VF-03 — CSVReconcile

**Product thesis:** Reconcile data exports  
**State:** IDEA / NOT BUILT / NOT RELEASED / REVENUE UNVERIFIED / NOT LISTED  
**Evidence posture:** Proposal; market demand and pricing are hypotheses.  
**Asset boundary:** Standalone buyer-transferable application, no strategic IMPERIAL Core IP conveyed by default.

## Buyer and job
**Ideal customer:** Operations analysts and small accounting teams.  
**Observed problem to validate:** Two exports disagree; manual comparison is error-prone.  
**Buying trigger to test:** repeated workload, loss, delay or operational risk tied to this job; confirm in interviews and paid pilot.

## MVP acceptance contract
- Customer can register/access a scoped workspace and input real but authorized data.
- Core vertical slice: Local-first import; key mapping; duplicate/unmatched row report; deterministic tolerance settings; report export.
- User can see and export results; durable state and delete policy documented.
- Core entities: `ReconciliationJob}`, `{SourceSchema}`, `{KeyMap}`, `{Rule}`, `{Mismatch}`, `{Export` (logical domain names; final schema TBD).
- Least privilege, tenant isolation, accessibility and restore/rollback evidence.
- Browser → API → database → response workflow independently tested.

## Excluded from v1
No financial advice; no destructive database writes.

## Risk register
Primary risk: **PII leakage, incorrect numerical tolerance, CSV injection**.  
Required mitigations: threat-model review, deny by default, scoped credentials, data minimization, validated exports, CI, independent QA, incident and recovery procedures.

## Commercial hypothesis and proof
- Buyer interview plan: Golden dataset correctness tests, 3 real-world sample formats, external pilot.
- Metrics to baseline and verify: Mismatch accuracy; false positives; time saved; user return rate.
- Pricing **TBD** after willingness-to-pay interviews. Never claim booked revenue without reconciled receipts.
- The transfer package must include exact source SHA, portable export/migration, runbook, dependency licenses, redacted demos and buyer acceptance.

## Exit/no-go boundaries
- No sale, licensing, domain transfer, customer-data release, paid infrastructure, or public production deployment without designated Founder authorization.
- Keep `Guardian Core`, `CYBER HAK`, `Approval Gateway`, `Audit Ledger`, `ProofGraph`, `AI Passport`, `Enterprise Skills` and public/private boundaries intact.
- No unapproved dependency on core IMPERIAL Core agents or protected algorithms.

## Evidence checklist
